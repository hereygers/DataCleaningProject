# DataCleaningProject Code Book
## Introduction
The tidy data set that is generated by the  repository includes the required R script run_analysis.R and the code book to explain the parameters of the tidy parameters.
Each row is an observation for a specific subject and activity and the mean values multiple variables are being provided.
## Variables
* "subject" 	ID identifying the respective volunteer
* "activity"  Activity Name (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING)
* "Time_BodyAcc_mean_X"	All succeeding variables have the same descriptive naming , starting with either "Time_" or "Frequency_" to indicate whether it is a time domain signal or frequency domain signal, followed by a feature indication e.g. "BodyAcc, and then followed by the indication whether the mean or std was estimated from the signal, and last but not least the direction indication X,Y or Z if appropriate.
  As all features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1] in the available raw data, so is there mean value.
